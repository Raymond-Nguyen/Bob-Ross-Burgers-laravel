  <p class="indent">Welcome to the About page! This page will go over why I made this website. So grab some
    popcorn-actually no, it may
    not take that long to read this to be perfectly honest. So, let's get started.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="indent">This website was made using Laravel. I created this website mainly to practice on and used Bob
    Ross's name to
    create the best online burger site out there (just kidding). I haven't added authentication, and to be honest, I
    probably won't. It's my first website, and I don't really think I need to create something like that for this site.
    I would
    like to put off that stuff for my next project.</p>
